# ruokalista

A recipe store: a Cloudflare Worker in TypeScript over D1. The wayfinder map
(issue #1) holds the decisions that were expensive to reverse, and `docs/spec.md`
is the v1 build spec — the schema, the screens and the intake flow, end to end.

v1 is being built in thin vertical slices, one PR per working thing. An earlier
attempt built it all in one 36-commit PR (#13, closed unmerged); it drifted from
the spec and grew three stacked fetch handlers, and none of it was reviewable.
Hence the slices, and hence the rule below.

## Running it

There is no node on this host. Every npm and wrangler command goes through a
container:

    ./scripts/node.sh npm install
    ./scripts/node.sh npm run typecheck
    ./scripts/node.sh npm run migrate:local
    ./scripts/node.sh npm run seed:local
    ./scripts/node.sh --serve npm run dev

`--serve` publishes port 8787 and belongs only to the dev server. Without it no
port is published, which is what lets you run a one-off command while the dev
server is up — publishing an already-bound port kills the container.

The dev server answers on `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. Use the IP, not `localhost` —
podman's port mapping here is IPv4-only and `localhost` resolves to `::1` first.

Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` for a local `SESSION_SECRET`. To call a
protected route before Google sign-in exists, mint a cookie for a seeded member:

    curl -H "Cookie: $(./scripts/node.sh node scripts/mint-cookie.mjs 1)" \
      http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/ingredients

That script is a developer tool, not a route. The Worker has no way to sign
anyone in without Google, on purpose — a shipped auth bypass is one of the things
that went wrong in #13.

`wrangler.jsonc` carries a placeholder `database_id`. Local dev does not need it;
the first remote deploy does — create the database with `wrangler d1 create
ruokalista` and paste the UUID in.

## One fetch handler

`src/index.ts` is the only `fetch` handler and `src/router.ts` is the only place
a request is matched. There is one `Env` (`src/env.ts`), bound once and passed
down; nothing copies or rewrites it, and nothing smuggles identity through it.
This is the shape the closed attempt got wrong, so it is written down.

Every route that touches household data is wrapped in `requireMember`
(`src/auth.ts`), and every query below it takes the member's `household_id` as a
parameter. There is no other way in.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues, PRDs and wayfinder maps live in this repo's GitHub Issues, driven with
the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage labels, unchanged: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`,
`ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See
`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root plus `docs/adr/`. Both exist —
`CONTEXT.md` is the glossary to use, and the ADRs record decisions that go past
what the wayfinder map locked. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
